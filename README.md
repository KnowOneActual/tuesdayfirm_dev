# **TUESDAYFIRM.DEV**

A cryptic, minimalist landing page for the tuesdayfirm.dev domain.

## **About**

This repository contains the source code for the landing page at [tuesdayfirm.dev](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://tuesdayfirm.dev). The domain is primarily used for email addresses, so a traditional website isn't necessary.  
Instead, this page serves as a "head-scratcher" â€” a simple, yet mysterious placeholder that hints at activity without revealing anything concrete.

## **The Concept**

The page is designed to look like a retro computer terminal. Upon visiting, a message is displayed, with its content changing depending on the day of the week.

* **Monday \- Sunday:** A series of vague, system-status-like messages are displayed.  
* **Tuesday:** A special message appears, acknowledging that "The firm is operative," as a nod to the domain name.

## **Deployment**

This is a single index.html file with no external dependencies beyond CDN-hosted CSS and fonts. To deploy:

1. Fork this repository or use the code directly.  
2. Host the index.html file on any static web hosting service (like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).  
3. If using GitHub Pages, simply enable it in your repository's settings to serve from the main branch.

## **Credits**

This page was built using:

* **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)  
* **Font:** [Space Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Mono) by Google Fonts.
