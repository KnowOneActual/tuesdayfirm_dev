 This project is a collection of thoughts and ideas—a public record of trying to build something from nothing.

## **About**

This repository contains the source code for the landing page at [tuesdayfirm.dev](https://tuesdayfirm.dev). 
For now, this page serves as a "head-scratcher" — a simple, yet mysterious placeholder that hints at activity without revealing anything concrete.

## **The Concept**

The page is designed to look like a retro computer terminal. Upon visiting, a message is displayed, with its content changing depending on the day of the week.

* **Monday \- Sunday:** A series of vague, system-status-like messages are displayed.  
* **Tuesday:** A special message appears, acknowledging that "The firm is operative," as a nod to the domain name.

## Features

-   **Minimalist Landing Page:** A clean, single-page site built with HTML and styled with Tailwind CSS.
-   **Animated Text:** A simple, type-in effect that displays a different message for each day of the week.
-   **The Folklore Modal:** An interactive pop-up that reveals the story behind The Tuesday Firm.
-   **A Hidden Welcome:** A cryptic message awaits those who open the developer console—a small nod to the curious.
    

## **This page was built using:**

* **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)  
* **Font:** [Space Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Mono) by Google Fonts.

## A Note on Transparency

This project started as a simple idea, a domain for an email and a Discord server. The goal was to create a supportive space for people who didn't think they could code or create. While that project is on hold, this site is the first step in moving that spirit forward. Everything you see here: the code, the story, the design—is part of that journey.
